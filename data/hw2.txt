Using the attached regression data, you are going to train a radial 
basis function (RBF) network network with one input, 
one output and H Gaussian units/experts.

Part 1:
Try at least three different H values so one underfits, one
fits well and one overfits. Implement the hybrid version 
(unsupervised in the first layer + supervised in the second layer). 
Use k-means for the unsupervised learning part. 

You should implement k-means yourself, i.e. not use a library.

For each case (underfitting, overfitting and good fit), 
after convergence, 
 a) plot input in the x axis and output produced by the network in the y axis (only for training set)
 b) plot the p_h(RBF), weighted values w_h*p_h with the training data together  
    with the training data so that we can see how the fit is distributed over the hidden units.

Part2:
Plot also training and validation root mean squared 
errors as a function of H from 1 to 10.
